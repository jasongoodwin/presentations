# ARC Industry Updates

---

# Agenda: 
- Themes
- Potential Opportunities

---

# Open Process Status
- Looks a lot like our architecture 
- Bus moves OPC data, "ecosystem" exists so that anyone can listen
- Distributed Control Nodes hang off of the bus.


^(Quantic CEO agreed with me, asked questions about bus)
^ Multiple groups are trying to standardize
^ Open Process is another attempt.

---

# Industrie 4.0 Overview
- Industry demands (we should listen)
- IT/OT Convergence
- Cloud
- Cybersecurity
- Standardization of Connected Devices
- IIoT

---

# IT/OT Convergence
- IT is moving into industry (software eating the world)
- IT and OT have to co-exist (think DevOps culture)
- Availability is a piece in the middle of the Venn diagram

---

# The Digital Twin
- A plant can replay data into virtual machines
- Allows testing ladder logic

---

# Cloud and Scalability
- Hybrid models are exist 
- Modern SCADA both local and large, distributed
- Standards are needed to ensure that large connected systems can talk
  - Eg plant level and central control

---

# Security 
- Most prevalent theme
- Consolidation and security need to go hand in hand
- Function of people, process, and product
- 'Air-gap' networks doesn't make anything secure
- The ability to write machine data could allow physical damage
- Not prevention, but impact mitigation (not if but when)

^ All it takes is a disgruntled employee.
^ ISA99/ISA62443 

---

# Positive Feedback about Ignition
- Visible product roadmap
- Scalability
- Security Compliance
- Bridges IT and OT
- Cultural Enablement

^ is it was installed under a desk
^ Within 4 days they had signals
^ Improved efficiency by 50% in a short period of time

---

# Smart Cities
- IOT (elevators, whatever)
- Security is critically important
- Megacities 2025 paper draws a series of pictures of security problems

^ Stories about the hotel with doors that unlock by cell phone
^ Held for ransom because of security flaw caused everyone to get locked out of their rooms

---

# Predictive Maintainance
- Get Data
- Train model
- Tell them when things will break
- Profit

^ I've been talkiing to brent about my ideas for anomaly detection to say when a machine will break for months
^ Found someone who actually did this
^ Blair Fraser (lakeside)
^ Said that the domain knowledge is more important than the data scientists

---

# Staying ahead of the curve
- Security 
- High availability

^ Assuming this is the way things move, our product is missing some features that people will be looking for

---

# Partner Opportunity?
- Quantic.ai (predictive analytics) use Kafka
- Could co-exist as MES, preventative maintenance product together.
